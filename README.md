# Ranked-Choice-Voting
This is a program for Ranked Choice Voting. Also known as Instant Runoff Voting, Ranked Choice Voting (RCV) is an alternative option for electing a winner from a pool of candidates. In this option, each voter ranks the candidates in order of preference. All of the voters' first choices are tallied and whichever candidate has the fewest first-choice votes is eliminated.  The votes are then tallied again this time counting the second-choice votes for those whose higher choice was eliminated. This pattern repeats until there is only one candidate remaining who is declared the winner. More information on RCV can be found here: https://ballotpedia.org/Ranked-choice_voting_(RCV).
